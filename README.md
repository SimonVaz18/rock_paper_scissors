## Overview

Rock Paper Scissors is a fun and interactive browser-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user plays against the computer in a best-of-10 format. The game keeps track of overall victories over multiple rounds. It runs entirely on the front-end and allows the user 10 rounds per match.

The design is intended to be playful and colourful, using emjois as game tokens and featuring glowing animations to enhance the user engagement.
