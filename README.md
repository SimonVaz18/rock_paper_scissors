## Overview

Rock Paper Scissors is a fun and interactive browser-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user plays against the computer in a best-of-10 format. The game keeps track of overall victories over multiple rounds. It runs entirely on the front-end and allows the user 10 rounds per match.

The design is intended to be playful and colourful, using emjois as game tokens and featuring glowing animations to enhance the user engagement.

 ### JavaScript Validation

 ### Bugs

 - During testing, I found that once 10 rounds had been played with the game finished and a winner decided, if the user continued to choose an option the round number would continue to increase e.g. Round 12/10. To mitigate this, I added a guard clause that protects the game logic from running once 10 rounds have already been played.
 - When executing the lighthouse testing, the SEO score was 90 due to no Meta description being present. Once I added a Meta the score increased to 100.
 - The 'Play Again' button had a brown background with white text. Upon review, these colours were not particularly enticing for the user to continue playing. As a result, I changed the colours to a shade of green with black text. 

 ### Unfixed Bugs

 - No unfixed bugs. 

 ### Improvements

 - **Sound Effects** - Add fun sounds when chosing moves and seeing results.
 - **Imrpove compuer logic** - Introduce smarter strategy to the computer opponent.
 -- **Theme Options** - Allow users to choose different themes relating to UI.
 - **Local Storage** - Persist total wins/losses even after refreshing or reopening the browser.
